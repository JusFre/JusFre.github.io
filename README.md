## How to navigate speedy success of a fictional bike-share company?



### Cyclistic bike-share case study:

Welcome,

As I approach the finish of my Google Data Analytics Certificate bootcamp on Coursera, It is my pleasure to present to you my final capstone project. In this case study, I will reveal the analysis of a public dataset for a fictional company provided as part of this course. For my analysis, I will utilize Excel spreadsheets for data processing and visualizations.

### Who is Cyclistic bike-share?

<ins>Company overview:

In 2016, Cyclistic launched an impressive bike-sharing program that swiftly gained popularity. It now operates 5,824 GPS-equipped bikes from 692 Chicago stations. These bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station within the system, offering users flexibility and convenience. Cyclistic's strategy emphasizes broad consumer reach. Their diverse pricing includes single-ride, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders choose passes, while subscribers become Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

<ins>Characters and team:

* ~Lily Moreno:~ The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

achieve them.
